You can choose from:
  - Simple sound alerts (with adjustable volume)
  - Windows notifications
  - Discord notifications via a webhook (which will also send the message to the channel)

<br/>


You can also select which channels to receive messages from if you dont want to hear <br/>the trash talk going on in system chat!

Originally coded as a "vibecoding" exercise by me without a clue what I was doing in python,<br/>
ive since done a bit of a crash course and started learning python and rewrote essentially <br/> 
all the code although I was definitely using the ai code as a reference.
