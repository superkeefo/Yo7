# Yo7
A simple tool that while running sends all cmdr chat to a discord webhook 
allowing you to get discord notifications, 
so you dont accidentally ignore real people like you do npcs...

You'll need a discord server so you can set up a webhook in a channel to receive the incoming chat.

Truth be told i'm not a coder and 'vibe coded' this with ai.
So the code may not be the prettiest. But it works perfectly for me, 
getting to share it and hopefully help anyone else with 
the same problem is a bonus.

If any coders want to look at the code and offer improvments etc feel free.
